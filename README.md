## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
By running linear regression on different variables versus MPG we can determine which factors are causal to the MPG.

### Vehicle Weight

The adjusted R-squared indicates that vehicle weight does not approximate MPG well, this coupled with the high p-value indicates that vehicle weight does not have a correlational relationship with MPG. 

### Vehicle Length

Although the adjusted R-squared does not indicate a strong relationship between vehicle length and MPG, the very low p-value indicates that this weak relationship is significant. 

### Spoiler Angle

The very high p-value and very low adjusted R-squared indicate that spoiler angle does not a relationship with MPG.

### Ground Clearance

Ground clearance has a low adjusted R-value and low p-value in relationship to MPG, indicating an insignificant relationship. 

### AWD

AWD has a low adjusted R-value and low p-value in relationship to MPG, indicating an insignificant relationship. 

### Summary
In summary, vehicle length is the only significant variable in predicting the MPG. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be 0, but it is very small and thus not significant. Thus, these linear models do not predict MPG effectively. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The guidelines for MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The manufactoring data for all the lost combined meets this specification, as well as the data for Lot 1 and Lot 2. However, Lot 3 on it's own does not meet this requirement.
